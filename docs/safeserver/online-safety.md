# Online Safety Do's and Don'ts

At Crafting For Christ, your safety is our top priority. While playing on our Minecraft server and connecting with others, it’s important to remember how to stay safe online. Following these simple tips will help you enjoy your time, stay healthy, and protect yourself from harm.

Here are some key "Do's" and "Don'ts" to help you make smart choices while playing Minecraft and interacting with others online.

## For the Players

### ✅ What to Do:
* **Keep Your Personal Information Private:** Never share details like your real name, home address, phone number, or school with anyone online. Even if someone seems nice, it's always safer to keep your personal information to yourself.
* **Stay in Group Conversations:** It’s always better to chat with other players in a group setting rather than one-on-one, especially if they’re older. Staying in groups helps you feel safe and keeps things open and honest.
* **Report Uncomfortable Situations:** If someone says or does something that makes you feel uncomfortable, or if they ask for personal information, don’t reply. Instead, use the `/report` command to let the Staff Team know what happened. Your safety comes first!

### ❌ What Not to Do:
* **Don’t Share Passwords or Login Info:** Never give out your passwords or account details to anyone, even friends. Keeping your account secure is important to protect your personal information and in-game items.
* **Don’t Download from Untrusted Links:** If someone sends you a link for a download—like a mod, texture pack, or anything else—make sure it’s from a source you trust. Downloads from unknown sources could contain viruses that harm your device or steal your information.
* **Don’t Keep Silent About Problems:** If someone is bothering you or being rude, don't keep it to yourself. Always report it to the Staff Team. You don’t have to deal with bad behavior alone.

## For the Players (who are parents)
We prioritize the safety of every player, including your children. While playing Minecraft online can be a fun experience, it's important to ensure their safety as they interact with others on the server. Below is a list of what to do and what to avoid to help you monitor your kids while they enjoy safely.

### ✅ What to Do:
* **Set Clear Rules for Online Interaction:** Discuss online safety with your child before they start playing. Set boundaries about what information they can share and who they can interact with.
* **Monitor Their Playtime:** Stay involved in your child’s gameplay by checking in occasionally or playing with them.
* **Use Server Tools:** On Crafting For Christ, players can use the `/report` command to flag inappropriate behavior or dangerous situations. Make sure your child knows how to use these tools to protect themselves.

### ❌ What Not to Do:
* **Don’t Allow Unsupervised Chats:** Discourage your child from engaging in private one-on-one conversations, especially with people they don't know. Group conversations are safer, as they provide more transparency and reduce the risk of inappropriate behavior.

By following these tips, you can help make our Minecraft server a fun and safe place for everyone. Stay smart, stay safe, and enjoy your time with us at Crafting For Christ!
