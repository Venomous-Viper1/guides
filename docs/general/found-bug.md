# I found a bug! How should I report it?

In the realm of software, bugs can be categorized into two types: those of minor consequence and those with the potential to cause significant harm if made public or exploited by malicious actors.

## Reporting Serious Bugs
If you suspect that you've stumbled upon a harmful or dangerous bug, we urge you to take immediate action:

* **Contact a Staff Member Privately:** Reach out to one of our Staff Members through private channels to report the issue discreetly. This ensures that sensitive information is handled with care.

* **Email Us:** You can also send us an email at support@craftingforchrist.net to report the bug. This method allows you to provide detailed information, which is especially important when dealing with potentially serious issues.

## Documenting Less Critical Bugs

Reports are to be made to the Issue tracker: https://github.com/craftingforchrist/Issues

:::

For bugs that are less severe and do not present immediate risks, we encourage you to contribute to our bug-tracking efforts:

* **Check the GitHub Bugs Repository:** Before documenting your bug, please check our current GitHub Bugs repository. It's possible that the issue you've encountered has already been documented by another user.

* **Document the Bug:** If your bug is not already listed, you are welcome to document it in our GitHub Bugs repository. Your contribution helps us improve our services and ensures that issues are addressed promptly.

Your vigilance and collaboration in reporting and documenting bugs are invaluable in maintaining the quality and security of our platform. Thank you for your dedication to making Crafting for Christ a safe and enjoyable environment for all.
