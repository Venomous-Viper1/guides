# I'm having issues connecting!

If you're experiencing issues connecting to the Crafting for Christ Minecraft servers, don't worry! Here are some simple troubleshooting steps to help you get back in the game:

# 1. Verify the Server IP
Ensure that you are using the correct server IP address: play.craftingforchrist.net. Typos can happen to anyone, so double-check your input to make sure it matches exactly. Check https://craftingforchrist.net/play to make sure it is correct.

# 2. Check Your Internet Connection
Make sure your internet connection is stable. You can test this by trying to visit other websites in your web browser. Sometimes, parental controls or network restrictions can block access to specific applications, including Minecraft.

# 3. Server Status
Occasionally, Minecraft logins may experience downtime, or our servers might be undergoing maintenance or experiencing technical issues. To stay informed, check our Discord server for updates. Additionally, you can verify if Minecraft itself is having any issues by visiting Mojang's official Twitter account.

# 4. Possible Ban or IP Block
If you find that you cannot connect, it's possible that you may have been banned from the server, or your IP address could be blocked for some reason. This can happen for various reasons, such as associating your IP with a set of bot accounts that we were trying to block. To resolve this, reach out to a Staff Member who will investigate the issue and provide assistance if necessary.

# 5. Seek Assistance
Don't hesitate to ask for help if you're still experiencing issues. You can reach out to a Staff Member in our Discord server, or you can email us at support@craftingforchrist.net. Our team is here to assist you and ensure you have a smooth and enjoyable Minecraft experience.

Remember, technical issues can happen to anyone, and our team is committed to helping you get back into the game as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience and dedication to Crafting for Christ Minecraft servers!
