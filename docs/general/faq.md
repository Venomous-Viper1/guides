# Frequently Asked Questions

# Why don't you support Cracked Minecraft Accounts?
Our server refuses to accept and support connections from cracked Minecraft accounts, grounded in both legal and biblical principles. 

From a legal standpoint, the use of cracked versions constitutes theft and piracy, violating the Eighth Commandment's directive against stealing (Exodus 20:15). 

Embracing legitimate Minecraft accounts aligns with Christian values of integrity, righteousness, and responsible stewardship, as emphasized in biblical passages such as Proverbs 10:9 and various teachings on fair compensation, such as 1 Corinthians 9:9.

Moreover, our commitment to creating a safe and secure gaming environment reflects biblical teachings on obedience to authority (Romans 13:1-2). By complying with Mojang's policies and community guidelines, we demonstrate a respect for the governing authorities in both the gaming world and our faith.

Inclusivity and fairness, as outlined in James 2:1-4, further guide our policy, ensuring that all players are treated equally and contributing to a positive and upright gaming community. Through these principles, our Christian Minecraft server strives to foster an environment that honors both the letter of the law and the spirit of Christian teachings.

# Why is the Nether not disabled, isn't it just Hell?
Our server upholds the inclusion of the Nether, recognizing its significance in fostering creativity, challenges, and community interaction within the game. Drawing inspiration from biblical principles of stewardship and dominion over resources, we believe that the Nether contributes to the diverse and imaginative aspects of Minecraft gameplay. 

By maintaining this dimension, players have the opportunity to explore, collaborate, and overcome challenges, aligning with the biblical encouragement to be a light to the world and engage positively with others (Matthew 5:14-16).

Disabling the Nether would not only compromise the core essence of Minecraft's gameplay. Our commitment to preserving the Nether reflects our dedication to creating a dynamic and enriching gaming experience that harmonizes with both Christian values and the fundamental principles of Minecraft.
